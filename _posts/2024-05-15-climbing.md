Personal relative rating:
Features:
* Extremely comfortable
Issues:
* Turned my feet blue! No matter how many times I wore them, they always turned my feet blue. That being said I've seen other people with the same shoe and they didn't seem to have the same issue.
* Laces are annoying, I'm a velcro strap guy now
